Takes a file and executes the machine language from that file.

I want to add two numbers together with machine language.
Put commands into a file so I can see the end result.

Use cases:
1. Adds 10+12 for 22.
2. Divide 20 by 2 for 10.
3. Saves a number in a memory location.
4. Write a number to the screen from memory location.
5. Subtract 10 from 35 for 25.
5. Multiply 5 by 5 for 25.
6. Change memory location.
7. Change memory location if input is negative.
8. halt the program by input.
9. Should be able add multiple memory locations together.
10. Should read a file I made for those instructions.
